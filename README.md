# Skydivemanifest
A tool to manage your dropzones manifest.

## Getting started

### Administration bundle
Please see the [REAMDE.md](administration/README.md) of the administration bundle for details.

## Roadmap
The first version is going to support a RESTful api as well as an administration interface to fill 
the api with data. Laravel will be used as framework for the api. The library Vue.js will be used
for the administration panel. Important functionalities are:
- User management
- Role management
- Permission handling
- Basic functions so have a working manifest app (adding aircrafts, skydiver, loads etc.)

In the second version the focus will be the UI and UX of the administration interface. Another
important feature will be the licensing. The administration panel should be able to check if the
product is registered.
